#ABOUT PROGRAM

Program for counting fields and figure surfacecs.
As inpuit to methods, it takes the necessary side lengths.

#VERSIONS

In the repository you can find three versions of the file, each in a different isues.

The first version of the software (issues-standard) uses autoconf, automake and 
creates the program described in #ABOUT PROGRAM, each next version 
also creates this program but with minor changes. 

The second version (issues-extended) has two static libraries. 

The latest version (issues-FULL) has a static and shared library, 
are configured with libtool.

Have fun :)
